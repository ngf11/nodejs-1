- Global objects in Js

console.log() // global object global scope we can accese it anywhere
setTimeOut() // we use this to call a function after a delay. we can use is on the client, we can you use this on the browser or inside of node
clearTimeOut()
setInterval() we use to repeatitive call a Æ’unction after a given delay
clearinterval() which we use to stop that function being call repeatitive

In browser we have this "window" objects that represents our global scope.
All the functions and variables that are definded globaly; we can access them via this window object
so we can call
-- window.consol.log or simpaly console.log

the javascript engine will prefix consol.log with window.consol.log
because this where this object is defin

also: All the previus globla object belong to the window object

In Node we do not have this window object

we have

- global
  all this the prvius global objects can be access in node thru the global
  global.consol.log

One thing we need to know about node
is that the variables that we defind on here; they are not added to the global object. In other words if we do a console.log(globla.variableName) and run the app in node. We will get undifined on the console. They are only scope to script.js. They are not avilable outside this file.

The variables and functions add to this file are not added to the global object. They are only scope to this file.
This is because of node modular system

- Modules

what we have learned is that in the cliant-side of Javascript; that we run inside of browsers when we declare a varibale or a function that is add it to the global scope.
for example:
const sayHello = function(){

}
this function is added to the global scope and it avablible via byt the window object
window.sayHello();

Now there is a problem with behavior. In a real world application we ofent split our javascript code into multiple files. Now it is posible that we have two files; and in both of these files we defind this fucntion say hello. With the exact same name because of this function is add to the global scope. When we define this function in another file that new defenition overite that previus defenition. This is problem with the global scope.

In order to bulit rilable and mantainable applications we should avoid defining functions in the global scope.

Insted we need modularity we need to create small buliding blocks or modules whwe we defind our variables and functions. So two functions with the same name do not overwrite another variable and function defined somewhere else that encaputalted inside of that module

At the core of node we have this concempt call module. So every file in anode aplication is concider a module(such as script.js or app.js). The variables and functions defind in that file or that module are scoped to that file.

In object oriented programing terms we say "they are private. They are not available outside that container(outside of that modual). If you want to use a variable or function defined in a module out that side of that module. We need explicity export it to make it public.

- Creating a Module
  We are going to add a new module logger.js to the application.
  Let imagin we are going to create a module for for login messeges. We are going to re use this module in differnt parts of this application or potentionaly in other applications.

so In logger.js. In this module let imagine that we are going to use one of those remote login services. For login our messeges. So they are websites that provide loggin as a service. They give us a url and we can send a HTTP to that url to log messges to the cloud.

so here we are going to a varibale
const url = "http//mylogger.io/log
ang of course this url is fake it may not get true selvice out there. But let imagine in this implementation we're going to send an HTTP request to this endpoint to this URl.

Now we also need a function and in this function we are going to send an HTTP request
function log(messege){
//sends an HTTP request
}

However to keep things simple here. We just want focus on the modulartity. We are not going to get destracted with all the details of sending HTTPs request. So for now I just want to log in this message on the console

function log(messege){
//sends an HTTP request
console.log(messege)
}

so the url variable and the log() function are scoped to this module logger.js. They are private they are not visible from the outside.
However in script.js which is our main module we want to use this logger.js module. We should be able to use this log() function. we should be able to call it from the script module. We need to make it public.

when we run in terminal node filename. one of the properties we see is exports{},
Now exports{}, is an empty object anythig that we add to this object "exports{}"
will be exported for this module and will be avilible outside of this module.

Back to our logger module
we are going to add
module.exports.log = log ;

In other words the object that we are exporting here has a single method called "log".
Now similary we want to export this url variable we can do something like this

module.exports.url = url;

we can of course change the name that we exported to the outside
for example: Internally we call this variable url but when is exported we may call it endpoint
module.exports.endPoint = url;

we are done with the loggger module. Now we need to load this module and use it inside script.js module

- loading module
